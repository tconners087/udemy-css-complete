Class vs ID selectors:
Classes are re-usable and allow you to name things for styling purposes only.
IDs are only used once-per-page and have a non-CSS meaning (on-page link).

!important
Overwrites specifity on all other selectors.

not()
:not(p) {
  //styles here
}
excludes the selectors included in the parenthesis.
